A website based on the RUSA algorithm for calculating open and close times
based on a milepost, called brevet distance, and the control posts along the way.

My implementation of the algorithm shifts the output time by minutes per Ali's suggestion.

If the user inputs a control point of more than 120% of the brevet distance it will return -1.

First, the
